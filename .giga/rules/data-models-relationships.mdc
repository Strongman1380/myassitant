## Core Data Models

### Memory Model
Importance Score: 95/100

Primary schema structure:
- Categories: biographical, preference, schedule, contact, work, personal, health
- Types: fact, routine, habit, preference, relationship, event, goal, skill
- Importance: low, medium, high, critical
- Metadata: tags, related entities, timestamps
- Context references: linked memories, source documents

### Event Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Event data relationships:
- Memory context integration
- Timezone-specific data (Central Time)
- Duration defaults
- Reminder associations
- Calendar service mappings

### Context Integration Model
Importance Score: 80/100

Relationship mappings:
- Memory-to-Event associations
- Memory-to-Email context linking
- Voice input to memory conversion
- Document parsing to structured memory

## Data Flow Architecture

### Memory Processing Pipeline
Importance Score: 90/100

```
Unstructured Input → Document Parser → Memory Extraction → Categorization → Storage
```

Memory relationships:
- Parent-child memory associations
- Cross-referenced context links
- Temporal relationships
- Source document linkages

### Assistant Context Integration
Importance Score: 85/100

Data flow structure:
- Memory database queries
- Email service integration
- Calendar context mapping
- Timezone standardization
- Communication style enforcement
