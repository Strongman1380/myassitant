# ai-integration-flows

## Core Integration Architecture
Importance Score: 90/100

The AI integration flows center around a memory-first architecture with bidirectional data flows between:

1. Memory Management System (`server/src/routes/memory.js`)
- Extracts and categorizes memories using AI taxonomy
- Processes unstructured inputs into structured memory formats
- Maintains context database for AI operations

2. Service-Specific AI Processing
- Email Generation (`api/ai/email.js`): Generates context-aware emails using memory system
- Calendar Processing (`api/ai/calendar.js`): Creates memory-enriched calendar events
- Voice Processing (`client/src/hooks/useAudioRecording.ts`): Handles audio capture and transcription

## Context Flow Pipeline
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Memory Context Integration
- Memory system provides contextual data to all AI services
- Automated metadata extraction enriches context
- Dynamic context updates based on new interactions

2. Service-Specific Flows
- Email: Memory → Style Rules → Generation → Formatting
- Calendar: Memory → Timezone Processing → Event Creation
- Voice: Capture → Transcription → Memory Extraction

## Data Categorization System
Importance Score: 80/100

Structured taxonomy for AI processing:
- Memory Categories: biographical, preference, schedule, contact, work, personal, health
- Memory Types: fact, routine, habit, preference, relationship, event, goal, skill
- Importance Classification: low, medium, high, critical

## Integration Points
Importance Score: 75/100

1. Assistant Integration (`api/ai/assistant.js`)
- Centralizes access to memory database
- Coordinates multi-service operations
- Enforces communication standards

2. Cross-Service Data Flow
- Memory system provides context to all services
- Services update memory system with new information
- Automated metadata extraction across all inputs
