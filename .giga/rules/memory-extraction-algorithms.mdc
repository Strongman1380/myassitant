## Memory Extraction Core
Path: `server/src/routes/memory.js`

The memory extraction system implements a specialized taxonomy for categorizing and structuring extracted information:

### Primary Categories
- Biographical
- Preference
- Schedule
- Contact
- Work
- Personal 
- Health

### Memory Classification Types
- Fact
- Routine
- Habit
- Preference
- Relationship
- Event
- Goal
- Skill

### Importance Classification
- Low
- Medium  
- High
- Critical

## Document Processing Pipeline
The document parsing system extracts structured memories through:

1. Automated metadata extraction
- Entity identification
- Tag generation
- Related entity mapping

2. Taxonomy Rules
- Category assignment based on content patterns
- Memory type classification
- Importance level determination

3. Contextual Processing
- Relationship mapping between extracted memories
- Cross-reference with existing memory database
- Entity disambiguation and linking

## Memory Storage Format
Extracted memories are stored with:
- Primary category
- Memory type classification
- Importance level
- Associated metadata
- Linked entities
- Source reference
- Extraction timestamp
- Confidence score
