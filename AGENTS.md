## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core System Architecture: AI-Powered Personal Assistant
Importance Score: 85/100

The system operates through four interconnected business components:

1. Memory Management Core (`server/src/routes/memory.js`)
- Structured memory taxonomy with categorization
  - Biographical, preference, schedule, contact, work, personal, health
  - Memory types: fact, routine, habit, preference, relationship, event
  - Importance classification: low, medium, high, critical
- Automated metadata and entity extraction
- Unstructured text to structured memory conversion

2. AI Assistant Orchestration (`api/ai/assistant.js`)
- Personal memory database integration
- Multi-service coordination (email, calendar, memory)
- Standardized communication rules
- Timezone-specific operations

3. Communication Pipeline
- Calendar Management (`api/ai/calendar.js`)
  - Central Time standardization
  - Memory-enhanced event creation
  - Smart reminder system
  
- Email Processing (`api/ai/email.js`)
  - Memory-contextual email generation
  - Format standardization
  - Professional tone calibration
  - Custom greeting and signature enforcement

4. Voice Input Processing (`client/src/hooks/useAudioRecording.ts`)
- Speech-to-text conversion pipeline
- OpenAI Whisper integration
- Voice-specific error handling

The system's distinguishing feature is its memory-first architecture, where all AI interactions are enhanced through personal context and automated metadata processing across multiple input modes.
